            <h3 class="text-center ">Youths must participate in SRHR engagement</h3>
            <p class="text-center">SRHR stands for Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights. It refers to the rights of individuals to have access to information, services, and education related to their sexual and reproductive. This includes the right to make informed decisions about one’s own reproductive and sexual health, as well as access to a range of services including family planning, HV prevention and treatment, and prenatal and postnatal care. <br>
              Youths, or young people, are particularly important in the context of SRHR because they are at critical stage of development and are often faced with a range of challenges related to their sexual and reproductive health. They may have limited access to accurate information and services, and may also face social barriers to accessing these resources. It is important that young people have access to comprehensive SRHR education and services in order to ensure that they can make informed decisions about their sexual and reproductive health and well-being. This can help reduce the risk of unintended pregnancies, sexually transmitted infections, and other negative health outcomes.
              <br>
              It is important for youth to participate in sexual and reproductive health and rights engagement for a number of reasons.
              <br>
              Firstly, young people have the right to accurate and comprehensive information about their sexual and reproductive health and to access the healthcare services they need. This includes the right to make informed decisions about their own bodies and lives, including the right to access contraception and other preventive measures, as well as the right to access safe abortion services where they are legal. By participating in SRHR engagement, young people can advocate for their own rights and ensure that they have the knowledge and resources they need to make informed decisions about their sexual and reproductive health.
              <br>
              Secondly, young people are often disproportionately affected by issues related to SRHR. For example, young people are at higher risk of unintended pregnancy, HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and other health problems related to sexual and reproductive health. By participating in SRHR engagement, young people can help to raise awareness about these issues and advocate for policies and practices that address the specific needs of young people.  
              <br>
              Finally, young people have a unique perspective and can contribute valuable insights and ideas to discussions about SRHR. By participating in SRHR engagement, young people can help to shape the policies and practices that affect their own lives and the lives of their peers. It can also help to promote a culture of openness and inclusivity, and can help to break down stigma and discrimination surrounding these issues and create a more equitable and just society for all.

          <h3 class="text-center ">Why SRHR Is Often Excluded From UHC</h3>
          <p class="text-center">Sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) are vital part of overall health and well-being, and should be included as part of universal health coverage (UHC). However, in many countries, SRHR services are not consistently included as part of UHC due to social, cultural, and political barriers. <br>
            One of the main reasons that SRHR components are not always included in UHC is that they are often viewed as controversial or sensitive, particularly in countries with conservative social norms or where certain aspects of SRHR, such as abortion or contraception, are legally restricted. For example, some people may object to the provision of certain types of contraceptives or abortion services on moral or religious grounds. In addition, there may be stigma attached to seeking SRHR services, which can discourage people from accessing them. 
            <br>
            As a result, governments and policymakers may be hesitant to include SRHR services in UHC packages for fear of backlash or resistance from certain segments of the population. This can also be due to a lack of understanding about the importance of SRHR for overall health and well-being, or because other health issues are perceived as more pressing.
            <br>
            Another reason is that SRHR can be costly to implement, as it often requires the training of specialized healthcare providers and the procurement of specialized medical equipment and supplies. In low and middle income countries, where resources may be limited, governments may prioritize other health interventions over SRHR.
            <br>
            Finally, the lack of political will to prioritize SRHR can also contribute to its exclusion from UHC packages. In some cases, governments may prioritize other issues or may not see the value in investing in SRHR. This can lead to a lack of funding and support for SRHR programs and services, making it difficult to include them in UHC packages.  
            <br>
            The exclusion of SRHR from UHC packages can be serious consequences for individuals and communities, particularly women and girls, who may be denied access to essential services and information. It is important for governments, civil society organizations, and other stakeholders to work together to address these barriers and ensure that all people have access to the SRHR services they need.
